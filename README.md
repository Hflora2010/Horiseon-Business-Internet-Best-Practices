# <Horiseon's Landing Page-Refactoring Code for Accessability>

## Description

Horiseon's landing page although from the outside looks clean, did not meet accessibility standards. I've refactored this code to make it cleaner for other coders in the future, for readers with disabilities who utilize screen readers, and for Horiseon itself for legal reasons and the opportunity to boost their site's viewing.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
