# Horiseon's Landing Page-Refactoring Code for Accessability

## Description

Horiseon's landing page although from the outside looks clean, did not meet accessibility standards. I've refactored this code to make it cleaner for other coders in the future, for readers with disabilities who utilize screen readers, and for Horiseon itself for legal reasons and the opportunity to boost their site's viewing.
